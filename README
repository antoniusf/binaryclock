This program is a simulation of an RGB-LED binary clock. It uses
binary notation for displaying the time and mixes the colors for
each bit. Red means hours, green minutes and blue seconds. Pressing
p pauses the clock, pressing it again continues. Holding h, m or s
shows only hours, minutes or seconds. Help can also be found in
binaryclock.png. Have fun with this clock!

Prerequisites:
Python 2.6
pygame

All files have to be in the same directory.

Under Linux, open a terminal, change to the directory where the files are lying and execute "chmod+x binaryclock.py" to make it executable.
Then just type "./binaryclock" to run it. If this doesn't work, try out "python binaryclock.py".

Under Windows, right click on binaryclock.py and select "Edit with IDLE". Then press F5 to execute it.
